# Save A Granny
The following is an ongoing project where I am creating tools to use to troll scammers. The following is should not be used to commit any types of fraud. There is no backend to any of the files in this repository, only frontends to mess around with scammers and to waist there time.

The Categories that I am planning on having are:
- Fake receipts generators (When a scammer asks for you to send them money, create a fake screenshot of a receipt and mess around with the scammer so they think that something is going on with their account)
- Fake giftcard redemption pages (Make the scammer think that you redeemed a giftcard, just like Kitboga. "WHY DID YOU REDEEM IT!?")
- Fake banking pages
- And more to come!
